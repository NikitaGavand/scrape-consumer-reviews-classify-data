# Data scraping and finding the reviews of the customer
In this application, we have collected the data from http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/ and then we have to extract the data from the html code I have used beautifulSoup to parse the HTML file and extract the data from a particular tag

Selecting three review categories : Cafe, Hotel, Restaurant¶
Here, I have performed
1. Data preprocessing
2. Building a classification model to distinguish between “positive” and “negative”¶
3. Evaluate the performance of each of your three classification models when applied to data from the other two selected categories.¶
